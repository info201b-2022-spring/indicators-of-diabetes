# Project Proposal
Group B-2: Daniella Tsing, Eugene Kim, Brandon Nguyen, Roberto Raftery

## Domain of Interest
In this section, you'll identify a domain that you are interested in (e.g., music, education, dance, immigration -- any field of your interest) and answer the following questions in your README.md file:

Why are you interested in this field/domain?

What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

## Finding Data
We are lucky enough to live in a time when there is lots of publicly available data made possible by governments, journalists, academics, and companies. In this section, you will identify and download at least 3 sources of data related to your domain of interest described above (into a folder you create called data/). You won't be required to use all of these sources, but it will give you practice discovering data. If your data is made available through a Web API, you don't need to download it. For each source of data, provide the following information:

Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?

How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

How many observations (rows) are in your data?

How many features (columns) are in the data?

What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
